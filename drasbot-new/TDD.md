# TDD Implementation Progress for DrasBot

## Overview

This document tracks the Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation of the new DrasBot architecture. We're following a systematic approach where tests are written before implementation to ensure quality and reliability.

- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing (15 tests)

#### 1.2 Configuration Service  
- **Tests Written**: Configuration loading, hot-reload, value access
- **Implementation**: Complete config service with file watching and merging
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and integrated

#### 1.3 Database Service

- **Implementation**: SQLite-based service with migrations and user operations
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented and integrated

#### 1.4 Bot Core
- **Tests Written**: Singleton pattern, initialization, status, lifecycle
- **Implementation**: Main bot orchestrator with service coordination
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing, application running successfully

## TDD Best Practices Applied

### 1. Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
- ✅ Write failing tests first
- ✅ Implement minimal code to pass tests
- ✅ Refactor for clarity and performance

### 2. Test Organization
- ✅ Clear test descriptions and grouping
- ✅ Setup and teardown for clean testing
- ✅ Mock external dependencies
- ✅ Test both happy and error paths

### 3. Code Quality
- ✅ High test coverage for critical paths
- ✅ Integration tests for service interactions
- ✅ Performance tests for bottlenecks
- ✅ Security tests for vulnerabilities

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the application
npm start

# Development mode
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement WhatsApp Client Service** - Start with connection tests
2. **Create Message Processor** - Focus on parsing and validation
3. **Build Plugin Loader** - Dynamic loading and management
4. **Develop Command System** - Extensible command framework
5. **Add Context Manager** - Conversation flow management

## Notes

- All core infrastructure is now complete and tested
- Application successfully starts and initializes all services
- Database migrations run automatically
- Configuration hot-reload is functional
- Logging system captures all activities
- Ready to proceed with WhatsApp integration
