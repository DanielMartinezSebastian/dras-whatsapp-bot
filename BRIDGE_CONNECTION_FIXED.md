# Bridge Connection Issue Resolution - 18 Jun 2025

## Problem Identified
The WhatsApp bridge was trying to send messages to the wrong port (3000) while the bot was running on port 3002.

## Error Messages in Bridge Logs
```
Failed to send message to bot: Post "http://localhost:3000/webhook/whatsapp": dial tcp [::1]:3000: connect: connection refused
```

## Messages That Were Lost
- "Hola" (17:24:24)
- "me llamo Daniel" (17:24:30) ‚ö†Ô∏è **Name registration attempt**
- "hola" (17:34:02)
- "hola" (17:34:08)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Process Cleanup
- Identified running processes: Bot (PID 35953) on port 3002, Bridge (PID 38227) on port 8080
- Terminated old bridge process using outdated configuration

### 2. Bridge Recompilation
```bash
cd /home/dras/Documentos/PROGRAMACION/drasBot/whatsapp-bridge
go build -o bridge main.go
```

### 3. Session Reset
- Removed old WhatsApp session data: `rm -rf store/*`
- This resolved connection conflicts and multiple session issues

### 4. Fresh Start
- Started bridge with clean session
- Bridge now shows QR code for new authentication
- Port configuration correctly set to 3002 in main.go

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Bot running on port 3002
- ‚úÖ Bridge compiled with correct port configuration
- üîÑ Waiting for QR code scan to complete WhatsApp authentication

## Next Steps
1. Scan QR code with WhatsApp mobile app
2. Test name registration flow with "me llamo [nombre]"
3. Verify random responses are working correctly

## Files Modified
- `whatsapp-bridge/main.go` - Already had correct port (3002)
- Bridge recompiled to ensure latest configuration is used
